# Dynamic GridLines UI

  This is the UI version of my [`Dynamic_Gridline_Chart_Scaling`](https://github.com/Theodor488/Dynamic_Gridline_Chart_Scaling) console-based project. The program plots random grid points onto a Cartesian plane and if any of the grid points are too close to each other (25 by default, but configurable), then it will set the grid point color to red, otherwise, it is green.
The idea behind the project is to ensure that all grid points' labels are not too close to each other and overlap.
